		  <p><strong>Educational Background</strong><br>
		    Sept. 1975 - Sept. 1978, Metallurgic Mechanics of Chongqing University, Bachelor.</p>
		  <p><strong>Working Experiences</strong><br>
		    Sept. 1978 - Jul. 1992, Institute  of Metallurgy Technology Research of Heilongjiang, Head of the  Research Section.<br>
		    July 1992 - Aug. 1994, Metallurgy Technology Development Co. of Heilongjiang,  Senior Engineer, Vice-general Manager.<br>
		    Aug. 1994 - Aug. 1995, Harbin University  of Science and Technology, Associate Professor.<br>
		    Sept. 1995 - Aug. 1999, Harbin University of Science and Technology, Associate Professor.<br>
		    Sept. 1999 - , Harbin University of Science and Technology, Professor.<br>
  <strong>Research Interests  and Expertise</strong><br>
		    Prof. WU Yubin’s research interests are the Alloy Cored Wire Technology for Secondry Refining  and  Metallurgy Electromechanical integration researches. He has been giving  lectures to both undergraduates and graduates of Material Modeling Technology  and Electromechanical Integration, and has achieved good teaching effects. </p>
		  <p><strong>Academic Achievements </strong><br>
		    Prof. WU has been engaged in the research of the alloy  cored wire technology for secondary refining, its equipment and the development  and application of the new technology of casting production. As early as 1986,  he started to engage himself in the key projects of the then Metallurgical Industry  Ministry Study of Manufacture and Application  of Alloy Cored Wire”. In 1987, he and his research group manufactured the first alloy  cored wire in China.  In 1990, the result of the research had been applied in many metallurgical  plants such as the Special Steel Plant in Fushun,  Beijing, and  Xining etc. and has created enormous economic benefits. In 2002, the spheroidization  of high magnesium alloy cored wire he invented fully replaced the pour-over  process, which resulted in the improvement of product quality, the decrease of processing  cost, less environmental pollution, the realization of manufacturing  mechanization and the reduction of labor intensity. At present, the scientific  results have been used nationwide in as many as one hundred enterprises. His  key project of National Seventh Five-year Plan, “Study of Manufacture and Application  of Alloy Cored Wire” has been awarded the Third Prize of National Award for Science  and Technology Progress of China.  Another project, “The Application of Cored Wire Technology in Making Ductile  Cast Iron” has been awarded the Third Prize for Science and Technology Progress  of Heilongjiang Province. </p>
		  <p><strong>Honors and Awards</strong></p>
		  <p>Prof. WU is one of the high-tech experts of Ministry of Machine Building and outstanding  contributors to high technology in Heilongjiang. What’s more, he is one of the specialists  and scholars who enjoy special government allowances of the State Council since  1992, and also a member of editorial committee of the journal <em>Applied Technology</em>. </p>
