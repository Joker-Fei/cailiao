		    Sept. 1979 - Dec. 1981, Harbin Institute of Electrical Technology,  majoring in Insulation Materials,  Master. <br>
		    Sept. 1999 - Nov. 2004, Harbin University of Science and Technology, majoring  in High Voltage and  Insulation Technology, Ph.D.</p>
		  <p><strong>Working Experiences</strong><br>
		    Sept. 1978 - Aug. 1995, Harbin Institute of Electrical Technology, Teaching Assistant, Lecturer,  Associate Professor.<br>
		    Sept. 1995 - Aug. 1998, Harbin University of Science and  Technology, Associate Professor.<br>
		    Sept. 1998 - , Harbin University of Science and  Technology, Professor.</p>
		  <p><strong>Research Interests and Expertise</strong><br>
		    Polymeric dielectric  materials, nano-duplicated polymer, the relationship between structure and  properties of polymer. In recent years, he has been giving lectures to both  undergraduates and postgraduates on polymeric articles physics, new advances of  materials science, the molecular design of polymer, etc, and good teaching  effect has been achieved.</p>
		  <p><strong>Academic Achievements</strong><br>
		    In the research  and application of semi-conductive polymeric materials, Professor FAN reveals the  relationship between the structure and its two properties: pressure-sensitivity  and temperature-sensitivity, proving that the structure of free radical chemical trap greatly  improves the thermal oxidation stability of semi-conductive polymeric material —  quinone. Basing on this research, he is the first person to use the semi-conductive  polymer as sensitive materials to successfully develop pressure and temperature  sensors. His main contributions are the methods of synthesis and preparation of  sensitive materials, membrane-making technology, sensor structure designing and  sealing technology under high temperature and high pressure. The testing  devices TSC and PSC under high pressure are the first in the country, by which  TSC and PSC of ordinary PI and nanometer PI membranes are measured for the  first time, improving testing methods. Prof. FAN developed high compatible inorganic nanometer  alumina oxide dispersed liquid by micro emulsification transformation  technology, which is used for heterozygous corona resistance polyimidemembrane  to improve its corona resistance. He found the  main reason why it is difficult to mix the nanometer alumina in polymer  materials, thus mastering the key technology of changing chemical anion trap  structure, its distribution and concentration in order to greatly improve  corona resistance of inorganic nanometer alumina heterozygous polyimide membrane. He chaired the project “The Relationship between the Structure  of Chemical Trap and Its Distribution and Dielectric Properties” sponsored by National Nature Science Foundation and  the project “The Preparation,  Dielectric Properties and Application of New Type Corona-Resistance Nano-Hybrid  PI Film”, a key project of  science and technology of Heilongjiang Province. He also participated  in several other projects, such as “The Preparation of New Semi-Conducting  Polymer Quinone Powder Materials and Application of Sensor” which was awarded national  invention second prize. The project “The Relaxation of Polymers after Heat and Characteristics  of Carrier Transportation” won second prize of the Scientific and Technological  Progress in Heilongjiang Province, and “The Research of Heat-Surged Electricity  Current and Conductivity of Polymer” won the first prize of Scientific AND  Technological Progress Award by National Administration of Machinery Industry.  Prof. FAN has published more than 40 papers and has obtained three national  invention patents.</p>
		  <p><strong>Honors and Awards</strong><br>
		    Prof. FAN is a Heilongjiang provincial  excellent young and middle-aged expert, a member of Insulation Materials and Insulation  Technology Branch Committee affiliated to China Electrotechnics Society, specially  invited professor, Heilongjiang scholar, and  a? national excellent teacher.</p>
