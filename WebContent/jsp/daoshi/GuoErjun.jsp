		  <p><strong>Research Interests and Expertise</strong><strong> </strong><br>
		    Prof. GUO Erjun’s research interests are Metal wear-resisting material, aluminum,  Magnesium Alloy, Material and  Casting Technique, and Special Ductile Cast Iron  . In recent years, he has been giving lectures to  both undergraduates and postgraduates on Introduction to Material Science and Function  Materials etc., and good results have been achieved.</p>
		  <p><strong>Academic Achievements</strong> <br>
		    Prof. GUO has been engaged in the teaching and research of the wear-resisting material, aluminum  magnesium alloy, heavy section ductile iron  and special  casting preparation. As to the wear-resisting material, he has,  on the basis of the theory and application of chrome-wolfram-iron,  chrome-nickel-iron, and copper-nickel-iron alloy, conducted the basic theory  research of new model of wear-resisting and erosion-resisting material, and applied  the new materials to the main parts of newly-developed airplane’s engine and the  scroll-cover of refining machines in paper mills, which has solved several  technical problems in the manufacture of new-modeled aircrafts and refining  machines. What’s more, he has made great achievements on the research of the  theory and the control technique of special ductile cast iron and aluminum magnesium alloy solidification. The nationalization of  high-performance crankshaft made of ductile casting  iron and cylinder head of alminum  alloy  ,  and the production of aeronautical thin-wall components of aluminum magnesium alloy and draping foil  of aluminum alloy,  filled domestic blank. He  has finished as many as twenty-nine various projects, for which he won three second  prizes and a third prize of Science and Technology Progress at provincial and  ministerial levels. He has published 1 monograph and more than sixty academic papers,  over twenty of which have been included in SCI and EI. <br>
		    <br>
  <strong>Honors and Awards</strong><br>
		    Prof. GUO is the winner of the 9th Harbin Youth Science and  Technology Prize and a Distinguished Teacher of Heilongjiang Province. Besides,  he is a committee member of National Teaching Guiding Committee, a director of  Chinese Society for Multiple Materials, a senior member of Mechanical  Engineering Society of China and the Chinese Society for Metals , a vice chairman of Heilongjiang Society for Metals, a committee  member of the Science and Technology Advisory Board and Heilongjiang Expert  Consultation Committee for SME, and also a committee member of Heilongjiang Experts  Committee for New Materials.</p>
