 School of Material Science &amp; Engineering in HUST has four  
departments, namely the Department of Metal Materials Engineering, 
?Department of Polymer Materials Engineering, the  Department of 
Inorganic Non-metallic Materials Engineering, and the Department  of 
Materials Formation and Control Engineering. It also includes analysis 
and testing  center, experimental centers, engineering practice centers 
and more than 20 research  groups. There are more than 90 staffs, 
including 33 professors, 36 associate  professors and senior engineers, 8
 doctoral supervisors, 48 master supervisors.  So, the main rational 
structure with doctoral supervisors, professors,  associate professors 
and PhD as is formed and it is an innovative teaching  staff full of 
vigor and vitality. Currently, there are more than 1,600  undergraduates
 and 300 graduate students.<br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are doctoral degree students and 
postdoctoral  scientific research students of materials science and 
engineering. It has the  right to grant master's degree for 5 subjects, 
that are, materials science,  material processing engineering, materials
 physics and chemistry, polymer  chemistry and physics (Science), high 
voltage and insulation technology (new  insulation materials). At the 
same time, it includes an authorized master degree  of engineering in 
the field of materials engineering and an authorized master degree  for 
teachers in-service. There is a provincial key disciplines-“Materials 
Science  and Engineering”, provincial key discipline groups-"Equipment  
Manufacturing Technology (covering materials processing engineering  
disciplines)", provincial key laboratory of universities-"Materials  
Research and Application", provincial key co-construction and sharing 
laboratory  for school and enterprises-"Magnesium Alloy Materials. In 
many large  enterprises, the graduate innovation base, and research and 
development centers  have been established. "Metal Materials 
Engineering" and  "Polymer Science and Engineering" are the national key
 disciplines,  "Material Forming and Control Engineering" and “Inorganic
 Non-metallic  Materials Engineering” are provincial key disciplines.<br>
		    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are good conditions for teaching, 
scientific  research and engineering training in this school The main 
analytical  instruments including transmission and scanning electron 
microscopy, X-ray  diffraction, FT-IR spectrometer, a digital optical 
microscopy, nanoindenter, direct-reading  spectrometer, gel permeation 
chromatography, thermogravimetry and differential  scanning calorimetry 
are imported from the United States, Japan, the  Netherlands and other 
countries. The total value of the equipments is worth  about 0.3 billion
 yuan and it provides a favorable protection for scientific  research 
and personnel training. <br>
