		  <p><strong>Research  Introduction</strong><br>
		    Professor Liu  Xiaojing mainly engaged in auto panel CAD/CAPP/CAE integration technology. Based  on numerical simulation technology, process optimization of auto panel has been  done, established computer aided process design systems and standard parts  library. Research on the car mold design integration technologies have been  carried out, and have gained the Natural Science Foundation of Heilongjiang  Province, “Car mold design key technology integration based FEA", Harbin  academic leaders fund "integrated design of automotive stamping key  technology" and other projects. In another research area, hydroforming  technology with independent radial hydraulic pressure, a forming device of radial  pressure hydrodynamic deep drawing equipment has been developed, by imposing radial pressure to blank flange area to improve forming  limit and formability, one step drawing ratio is increased to 2.7. In 2009, in  this area, a national invention patents was received. Published more than 30 scientific  research papers and 20 papers have been quoted <a href="http://www.iciba.com/by/" target="_blank">by</a> SCI and EI. <br>
