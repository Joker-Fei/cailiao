		  <p><strong>Research Interests  and Expertise</strong><br>
		    Prof. ZHANG Xianyou’s research interests are in Processing and Application of Inorganic  Non-metallic Materials, especially in the application of Silicon Ash Rock Processing Technology and the Research and Application Functional  Inorganic Non-metallic Materials. He also focuses on the development and  application of Special Cable Material, more on the research of Radiation Cross-linking  Cable Materials, High-temperature-resistant Flame-retardant Cable Material and Cable  Material Compound Flame -retardants and Master Batch.</p>
		  <p><strong>Academic Achievements</strong><br>
		    Prof. ZHANG has been engaged in the research of Semi mineral silicon sheet paint  of large generators, which solved such such?problems as binder adhesion, manufacturing and thickening edge besmear not paint, inorganic  material surface modification of the binder etc. The product has passed the  comprehensive quality authentication of GE in Canada, and has been used for Ertan  55-60 million kilowatts of large power equipment, made by Harbin Motor Manufacturing  Co., LTD, East Motor Manufacturing Co. LTD, with an economic benefit of over 50,000,000 Yuan. While doing research in the  area of the application of the special cable material, Prof. ZHANG has worked  more on the research of radiation cross-linking cable materials, high-temperature-resistant  flame-retardant cable materials and cable material compound flame-retardants  and master batch. His research reached the advanced international level of the late  1980s. In his research, the high-tech nuclear power has been fully used to  develop new wire and cable products, which diversifies the radiation cross-linking  wire and cable products. His research makes it possible for China to export  radiation cross-linking wire and cable. The research results have been converted  into actual product, whose economic benefit is over 20,000,000Yuan. His  research results have been awarded the Second Prize of Machinery Department  Award for Science and Technology Progress, the First Harbin Youth Science and Technology  Prize, and the Fourth Prize of Heilongjiang Award  for Science and Technology Progress, the First Prize of Machinery Department for Science and Technology Progress.</p>
